Images Build using Other Docker Repositories

This repository is intended to demonstrate how docker images behaves when are
pushed to Docker Hub and a container called "A" is used to built up another
solution called "B".

e.g.

Built image A
Build another image from image "A" and add another layer.

POC:
Demonstrate whether All `docker pull B:tag` ends up increasing the number of pulls in image "A"
